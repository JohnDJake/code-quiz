# JavaScript Quiz (Homework 04)

## Description

This is a quiz about JavaScript, written in JavaScript. The quiz is timed, and each wrong answer subtracts ten seconds from the remaining time. The score is the amount of time remaining when all of the questions are answered, or zero if the user runs out of time. The user then has the option to enter their initials to save their score locally, where it can be viewed on the highscores page. This project was an exercise in JavaScript DOM manipulation, JSON, and localStorage.
